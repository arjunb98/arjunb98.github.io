                    <p>
                            I was initially drawn to computer science by my fascination with algorithmic problems that I was exposed to in my high school computer science classes and the USA computing olympiad. 
                            While I still enjoy working on these problems and am still an avid contest programmer, my main interest has shifted to statistical and machine learning. 
                            The reason I'm so interested in statistical and machine learning is because this field combines my favorite parts of computer science, mathematics and statistics.
                            I enjoy working on challenging problems in this area and I’m eager to learn more about these fields.<br>
                            <br>
                            I’ve been fortunate enough to work on machine learning problems during my past two summer internships. Two summers ago I worked on improving signal-integrity modeling at Intel. 
                            Last summer I implemented a new anomaly detection algorithm on the Analytics team at Google. This summer I’m exploring a somewhat different opportunity in quantitative finance at 
                            Jane Street and I'm eager to see how my interests apply to problems in finance. <br>
                            <br>
                            While I’ve worked on applied ML in the industry, I've also conducted some more theoretically involved undergraduate research. My honors thesis focuses on a more theoretically principled approach to understanding 
                            the tradeoffs between accuracy and robustness with regards adversarial learning.<br>
                            <br>
                            I’m not quite sure if I want to pursue a career in finance, go back to tech or go into academia. However, regardless of what I do, I’m determined to keep learning and
                             make the most of my opportunities.<br>
                            <br>
                            Though I’m very passionate about my work, I do occasionally step outside. When I’m not studying you can probably find me throwing a frisbee at the nearest field,
                            dancing or baking my signature chocolate chip cookies.<br>

                    Analytics </a> users with improved insights. 
                    <br>After implementing it and testing it, I added the algorithm to the insight generation pipeline in production to compute and serve insights to millions of Google Analytics users.
                    <br>Because the new anomaly detection algorithm was a significant improvement I also wrote an extensively documented library around the algorithm to make it available to teams

                                The purpose of this assignment was to select a technical concept and write a description of it. The concept that I selected for this assignment was how a neural network works. I chose this because I think deep learning is pretty complicated and felt it would be a good challenge for me to describe a complex model like a neural net. This project demonstrates my ability to effectively describe a complex idea and also showcases my effective use of design and incorporation of graphics and figures.

                        In this section I’ll be reflecting on my experience in English 202c. In order to do this, I’ll reflect on the class in general, the projects, the utility of course going forward, and the choices I made for this portfolio.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>The Course</strong><br><br>
                        Coming in to English 202c I had a relatively high opinion about my technical communication skills. After all, I’d already worked in real companies and conducted my own research. I expected the course to cover basic ideas in technical writing like how to write professional emails. I was pleased when a lot of the strategies that Dr. Vallee discussed went beyond surface level ideas and because of this I got much more out of the course than I expected. A great example of this was the class in which we discussed stylistic decisions with regards to color and font. These ideas were new to me and I now think a lot more about how I use color and font choice when I write technical documents. 
                        <br><br>
                        While not every lesson was groundbreaking or new, I think all of the work in this class is quite applicable in the workplace. From the resumes and cover letters needed to obtain a job to the technical definition document needed to explain your work, there was a clear motivation behind each project. Though the assignments were tedious at times, refreshing my skills and developing new ones will be useful when I have to write a similar document in the workplace.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>Projects</strong><br><br>
                        I chose to include my technical definition and description document (TDD) and instruction set for several reasons. For one they both focus on neural networks and my instruction set references my TDD multiple times. Also, both of these documents focus on the basics of deep learning which is in line with my professional interests. Showcasing my technical writing skill in the context of my is an effective way to demonstrate my ability in both areas at the time.
                        <br><br>
                        The specific technical writing skills that these projects showcase are primarily centered around communicating complex material in an understandable fashion. There is no easy way to explain neural networks to someone who hasn’t studied the subject and by including these I demonstrate my ability to communicate about them in a professional and technical manner. However I also demonstrate some ability with design as I think these projects are formatted in a elegant manner. Finally, the use of jupyter notebooks to make an interactive instruction set showcases my ability to employ technology effectively. This skill is particularly important to showcase as a computer science major.
                        <br><br>
                        All of the skills that these projects showcase were improved during the course. However, I revisited and improved several others including my rhetorical analysis, sentence composition, document organization and collaboration skills.
                        <br><br>
                        I hope visitors see the development of the technical skills that I previously mentioned through these projects and also gain some insight into my knowledge about my field of interest.
                        <br><br>
                        
                        <strong>Career</strong><br><br>
                        The most obvious way that this course has impacted my career can be seen on my resume. In the past I’d relied on impressive accomplishments to impress recruiters and secure interviews. However, in this course I took a closer looking at my phrasing and found many things that could be improved.

                        However, technical communication will be useful to me regardless of the career I pursue. If I go into academia a lot of my work will involve writing academic papers. An example of a technical document. If I go into industry, the ability to explain my work like we did in the TDD and help others reproduce it in the instruction set will be very useful as all of the work done in the tech industry needs to be communicated to your team.

                        To make concrete I’ll provide an example from my internship last summer. During this internship I implemented an anomaly-detection algorithm and before leaving I had to make sure that the rest of the team understood how it worked. In order to ensure this I had to include a design document that explained the mathematics and implementation of the algorithm. A document like this is incredibly similar to the TDD that we worked on in class and I almost wish I had Dr. Vallee’s resources to lean on while I was writing this document.

                        <strong>The Portfolio</strong><br><br>
                        One big choice I made when constructing my eportfolio was to make on my own website outside of wordpress. It makes a lot of sense for me to do this as a computer science major but I think another reason that I was motivated to do it was that throughout the course Dr. Vallee has pushed and rewarded the incorporation of innovations into our assignments. This encouragement helped motivate to go above and beyond. 
                        <br><br>
                        I also included another page about contest results despite it not being listed in the assignment description. I think that in a portfolio that showcases my professional accomplishments and conveys who I am, I need to show my love of competition and a few successful results.
                        <br><br>
                        Besides the innovations and design choices, I constructed my whole portfolio with a profile of the potential visitors in my mind. To me these would be professional connections as I’m not really looking for a job, but I am currently working in the industry. Because of this, I don’t mention seeking employment and instead try to convey my experience and my interests in a more conversational tone so that other professionals will look at my portfolio and reach out to me if our interests are similar. In addition, I broke up my experience and education as this helps to differentiate my portfolio and resume and lets visitors zero in on the information that they find interesting.
